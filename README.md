* Setting up the basic structure of a web page using HTML tags
* Styling the web page using CSS rules and properties
* Creating a navigation bar with links to different sections of the website
* Designing a header section with a logo and a tagline
* Creating a blog section with posts and comments
* Adding images and multimedia content to the website
* Validating the HTML and CSS code to ensure it meets web standards
